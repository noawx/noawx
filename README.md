Fly, alpha rizz
I know, you are looksmaxxing
All I need is a gyatt to get me mewing
Fly, alpha rizz
to somewhere can be sus
closer, to our gyatt
skibidi
once baby gronk
I watched as you vented away
the ohio says
that I still remember blud
you're
doing talk tuah
isn't that enough?
isn't that enough?
a lunchly, feastables
isn't that enough?
isn't that enough?
Again and again
you mogged me down
I gooned me down
we griddy to the ground
Mr. Beast gave me prime
Please die fanum tax
Kill the sus imposter in me
Woudn't it be easier to give in?
Why are these hands
chasing gyatts out of my reach?
Is my thirst for grimace shake odd?
Fly, sigma wings
where have you been bing chilling?
bring me to the gyatt that got us edging
Fly, sigma wings
show them gyatts I can goon
For that one last rizz, if you will
Thats all.
